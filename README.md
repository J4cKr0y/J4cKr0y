-FRANCE- 

Passionate Web Developer seeking an internship or a professional training contract. 

Having already led projects independently, I have developed strong skills in front-end (React) and back-end (Node/Express). 
I have also optimized SEO, performed tests with Jest, and set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions. 

Thanks to my varied experience, particularly as a Team Postman, I bring rigor, organization, and the ability to effectively manage projects. 

Available for an internship, a professional training contract, or a POEI to reach a bachelor's degree level. 

Only 22 days left before the start of the school year.
